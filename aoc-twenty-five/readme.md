Why you might ask? Honestly just to see if any of them seem like a fun hobby language or if any of them really spark joy. So far my favorite is Rust.

# Haskell

Fun once you learn the concepts. Very satisfying code to write. Very hard to learn (as in a huge up front cost)

Pros:
- Really cool type system
- Love how everything is a function
- Seems very elegant
- Hoogle is soooo cool!

Neutral:
- Finding "how do I do this in Haskell" is kind of hard

Cons:
- Very different to the style of programming that I'm used to
- Slow to compile
- Build story was challenging. Stack seems to download A LOT of things and cabal is just very foreign

# OCaml

Fun and pretty easy to get going

Pros:
- Somewhat easier to understand than Haskell (despite being very similar. Probably fewer special symbols used)
- Docs are great. Website is great
- Pretty easy to find "how do I do this"

Neutral:
- Build & package management present and works. No other opinion beyond that

Cons:
- Single pass compiler so there's an order to declarations (not the worst thing)
- C-style printf
